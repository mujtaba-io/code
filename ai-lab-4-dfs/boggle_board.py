# make a character matrix 4x4 (boggle board) with different characters and use DFS to find a word in the matrix. words will be pre-defined in a list. and we need to search for all 8 directions for each character in the matrix.

# In the boggle board, we can move to any of 8 adjacent characters, but a word should be constructed by a sequence of adjacent characters. Weâ€™ll use a dictionary to store the words and a matrix to store the characters.
