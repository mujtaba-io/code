## About

I have been developing computer programs since I was in grade 9. By grade 12, I developed relatively complex architectures for large scale software. By the end of my 1st year in university, I developed a freelancing application, and been working in AI and ML afterwards. Currently, I am working on several open source project initiatives under the name of ProgramX.


## Education

**Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering**  
COMSATS University, Islamabad (2022 to 2026)


## Projects

Although comprehensive, but I filtered out best of my projects. All projects listed below are industry quality and not open sourced.

### E-commerce Marketplace Website (2021)
My first freelance work. I took requirements and created this website. It was a Django-based server with an HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap frontend.    
Complexity level: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5)

### Freelancing Marketplace Platform (2022)
Perhaps the most complex project I have ever taken. It was security-critical as it had payment methods integrated and user content security. I started with requirements elicitation and feasibility study, followed by the design and implementation. The model I used for the development was what I called "nested-iterative", in which each iteration itself is a whole new cycle of software development. This kept the risk to lowest. Project deployment cost and lack of funds resulted in project never being released.    
Complexity level: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)

### Unified AI Tool (2023)
My recent open source initiative, it is hightly volatile and I continue to develop it. It is stil in early stage of development.    
[Current] Complexity level: ⭐️ (1/5)

### 2D Games (2021 - present)
Written several 2D games in Godot and in Scratch. Most of them being part of my freelancing work.    
Complexity level: ⭐️⭐️ (2/5)

### 3D Games (2021 - 2023)
Worked in several 3D games in Godot Engine. Some of the important tasks included were infinite procedural content generation and shaders. Mostly as a part of my freelance work.    
Complexity level: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4/5)
